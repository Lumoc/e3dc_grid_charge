## Original README
### What is this about?

This will get prices from the tibber api, find out the cheapest hours and charge an E3 DC battey storage system via
e3dc rscp protocol mainly based on https://github.com/git-kick/ioBroker.e3dc-rscp

The idea is to use energy when it is cheaply available and not beeing needed by most people on the energy grid.
As prices on the epex spot market are released at about 13:00 this software will ask for the day ahead prices at about 14:00 and search for the x cheapest hours for the next 24 hours.
The prices and the selected hours can be viewed with a webserver on port 8080 -> http://localhost:8080/

Be careful with this, this is a very early version. If you plan to use this be sure you know what you are doing.
